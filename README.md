# Diabetes Prediction Using Ensembling of Different Machine Learning Classifiers
Diabetes is a kind of metabolic diseases which forms by lack of insulin due to malfunctioning of pancreas. Diabetes can push a person into pathological destruction of pancreatic beta cells, coma, cardiovascular dysfunction, renal  andretinal failure, joint failure, sexual dysfunction, pathogenic effects on immunity, weight loss, and peripheral vascular diseases. So, for the early detection of diabetes, a  robust  framework  was proposed where outlier rejection, filling the missing values, data standardization, K-fold validation, and different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers (k-NN, decision trees, random forest, adaBoost, naive bayes, and XGBoost) were used. To improve the result, weighted ensembling of different ML models also proposed here. The corresponding Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) of ML model as the performance metric estimated these weights. Using  grid  search  technique, the AUC is then maximized during hyper-parameter tuning. All  experiments  were  conducted  under  the same experimental conditions on publicly available Pima  Indian  population  near  Phoenix,  Ari-zona of  768  female  diabetic  patients where there are 268  diabetic  patients  (positive)  and 500 non-diabetic patients (negative) with eight different attributes. The proposed framework of our proposal is shown in figure below.
